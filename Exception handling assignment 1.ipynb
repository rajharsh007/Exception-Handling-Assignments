    "#### Ans:- Exception in Python:\n",
    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, which is a special type of object that represents the error or problem. Exceptions allow you to handle errors gracefully and provide a way to recover from unexpected situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differences between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nature of Occurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax Error: These occur when you write code that violates the rules of Python's syntax. They are usually detected by the Python interpreter before the code is executed. Syntax errors prevent your code from running at all.\n",
    "#### Exception: These occur during the execution of your code. They might happen due to various reasons, such as invalid input, resource unavailability, or other runtime issues. Exceptions can occur even if your code is syntactically correct.\n",
    "#### Detection:\n",
    "#### Syntax Error: Detected by the Python interpreter before the code starts running. These errors prevent your program from entering the execution phase.\n",
    "#### Exception: Detected during the execution of the program when the problematic code is being executed. The program can be in a running state when an exception occurs.\n",
    "#### Handling:\n",
    "#### Syntax Error: These are typically fixed by correcting the syntax in your code before running it. They don't require explicit exception handling because the code won't run until the syntax is corrected.\n",
    "#### Exception: Exceptions should be handled using try and except blocks. This allows you to catch exceptions, take appropriate actions, and prevent your program from crashing.\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "#### Syntax Error: Forgetting to close a parenthesis or using an undefined variable are examples of syntax errors.\n",
    "#### Exception: Examples of exceptions include trying to open a file that doesn't exist, dividing by zero, or accessing an index that is out of range in a list.\n",
    "#### In summary, syntax errors are mistakes in the structure of your code that prevent it from even starting to execute. Exceptions, on the other hand, are errors that occur during the execution of your program and can be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms like try and except.\n",

    "#### Ans:- Custom exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, are exceptions that you create yourself in Python. These exceptions allow you to define specific error conditions that are relevant to your program or application. While Python provides a variety of built-in exception classes, sometimes it's beneficial to define your own exceptions to capture unique error situations in a more meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom exceptions provide several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Clarity: By creating custom exceptions, you can give your errors meaningful names that describe the issues specific to your application. This enhances code readability and makes it easier to understand what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Modularity: Custom exceptions allow you to modularize error handling. You can raise these exceptions in different parts of your code and catch them at higher levels to handle errors appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Hierarchical Structure: You can create a hierarchy of custom exceptions by defining parent and child exceptions. This allows you to catch more general exceptions at a higher level and more specific exceptions at lower levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Maintenance: If your application grows or evolves, custom exceptions can help you maintain error handling more effectively, as changes to error conditions can be made in one place.\n",
